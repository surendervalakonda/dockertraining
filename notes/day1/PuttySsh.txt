Do the following on linux boxes
-------------------------------
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl status ssh

########################
CentOS

sudo yum â€“y install openssh-server openssh-clients
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl status sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd

systemctl stop sshd
service sshd restart

Open putty in windows (if not present install)
	Enter host as user@ip
		e.g. docker@192.168.56.128
	Protocol should be ssh
	Port can be 22
	Click Open

now we should be able to work from putty just like from local machine
We can copy paste between these terminals too.
